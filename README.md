# Acala Grants Program

![Logo](/src/acala%20grants%20program%20banner.png)

## :checkered_flag: Mission
The Acala Foundation Grants Program focuses on software development and research in the field of decentralized finance protocols that benefit the Acala and Karura ecosystem.

The maximum amount of funding per application is limited to US$50,000. Larger funding requests will require more evaluation and due diligence, and hence the longer decision time.

Announcements about receiving an Acala Grant can only be made once the 1st milestone is accepted. Teams shouldn't seek to cover 100% of their funding via the Acala Grants Program. 

## :memo: Guidelines
We are focused on funding technical projects that add value to the Acala & Karura ecosystem. These are the general guidelines for grant applications:

* It is a well-researched or well-tested idea, ideally **with a proof-of-concept** or prior work to demonstrate feasibility.
* It shall demonstrate the project will be **deployed, maintained and operated** after completion of the grant, through commitment of funding or its economic or business models.
* It shall demonstrate how the project can/will **specifically benefit** to the Acala network and/or its ecosystem, both technologically and economically.
* The team has **proven experience** and track record for solid delivery.
* It contains well-defined technical details.
* It presents how your project is **differentiated** from comparable products in the ecosystem or in other comparable ecosystems.
* All code produced as part of a grant must be open-sourced.

## :scroll: Process

### :pushpin: 1. Application

Apply [Here](https://forms.gle/2G6yHYJG9yTg6q2UA). Please discuss with us if you are unsure of any aspect of the application. You can contact us at <grants@acala.foundation>.

### :mag: 2. Review and Decision
The Acala Grants committee on behalf of the Acala Foundation will review the application and determine if additional information is required. Once a decision is made, the application team will be notified, and follow-ups will be arranged.

### :rocket: 3. Milestone Deliverables
Milestone deliverables shall be submitted via email to <grants@acala.foundation>, and follow the guidelines below:

* **Code completeness**: please ensure submitted milestone contains complete codebase that is compilable and runnable. 
* **Tests**: provide step-by-step guide to demonstrate how the code achieves the milestone. It should contain unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests (steps to perform actions on a mobile/web app if applicable).
* **Deployment and running application (if applicable)**: provide step-by-step guide to deploy and run the contracts, protocols and application programs
* **License**: be sure to include license for each repo.
* **Documentation**: provide documentation for APIs, architecture and overview of the project, algorithms and mechanisms of the protocols, tutorials and articles that articulate using the protocols and applications. 
* **List each milestone deliverable**: provide enough details e.g. links to specific code/repo location, documentation and guide so that we can easily verify the deliverables against the original application.

### :loudspeaker: 4. Announcement Guidelines
We demand grant teams only make announcements after the first milestone has been accepted. This is to protect the community from projects that only intend to use the announcement to raise funds or create hype but don't intend to deliver, deploy and operate on project. We reserve the right to terminate grants if this is violated. 

Below are guidelines for announcement
* It should focus on the **technology** and **products** being developed and/or deployed rather than pure marketing announcement.
* Ideally it should include a demonstration of the product, and a guide for users and/or developers to use it.
* It should include links to Github repo and deployed website/app
* Dos/Don'ts of language in the announcement
  * Do NOT use terms like `partner`, `partnership`, `strategic`, `affiliate` that implies relationship of two entities due to the nature of Acala/Karura network
  * Do use specific words like `integrate`, `deploy on`, `build`, `compose with` to elaborate the specifics of the project
  * Do NOT indicate Acala/Karura prefers a certain technology over others, as both are open platforms

We look forward to building with you and creating more open and democratizing finance technologies! Please email <grants@acala.foundation> if you have any questions.
